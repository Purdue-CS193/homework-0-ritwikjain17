# Ritwik's First CS193 Homework

Things I like about CS193 are :-
- The lecturers, because they are willing to answer any questions or concerns we might have. And as they are students too, it feels easier and more comfortable to approach them regarding anything I might need guidance on.
- The fun activities/questions at the start of every class session. 
- The class aims to teach us skills that are essential in order to work collaboratively on projects and get into the software development industry. 
- The small size of the class, as it facilitates better interaction with others which helped me make a new friend.
- Lastly, I just like the fact that it is not a super rigorous class and feels like a breather coming directly from my multi-variable calculus lecture.
